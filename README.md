To download it head to the [Releases section](https://github.com/hube12/MineMap/releases/latest).

To run it: either double click it on it if you have the [Java Runtime (JRE)](https://www.java.com/fr/download/) or use
the command line (shift+right click in the folder then open command prompt/Powershell) and
type `java -jar MineMap-X.X.X.jar`.

This is a program to replace the old amidst with a non Minecraft based one (meaning you can run it without Minecraft
installed), it is also way more efficient since it is fully multithreaded.

There are severals nice features added, you can see per layers of biome generation, find closest structures, draw
circle, area and use a ruler.

Supports all Minecraft release starting from 1.0+

## Support and bugs

- This project is still in its enfancy (while packing most of the necessary features) so bug will likely still happen
  inside it.

- However, as it is actively maintained you can get a hold of me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/mn47bWvFjf) or by
  simply submitting a bug report in the [Issues](https://github.com/hube12/MineMap/issues) tab.

- We also have a roadmap of future ideas [here](https://github.com/hube12/MineMap/projects/1) and you are welcome to
  open a discussion [here](https://github.com/hube12/MineMap/discussions) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/xa6cpSjsqZ)
  to ask for any feature that you deem reasonable enough (be aware for performance issues some might be denied).

## Known issues

- Linux gpu performance-> this is due to java not providing a gpu backend on some distros and using cpu rendering
  instead (you can try tweaking wayland, adding proprietary drivers or enabling sun opengl backend)

- Weird artefacts appears on windows -> you are using Riva Tuner or MSI Afterburner which tampers with java swing. You
  should disable them or add an exception for all java.exe apps or Minemap-*.exe.

- Minemap fails to start, maybe some config was not correctly written, go to $HOME/.minemap or %HOMEPATH%/.minemap and
  delete the config folder.

- Minemap fails to update, maybe you are ratelimited by Github, please try later.

## Development

You just need to have the Java JDK installed then do:
`git clone https://github.com/hube12/MineMap`

Go in the directory and run `./gradlew run` to run Minemap (we enable the no-update option)

Run `./gradlew shadowJar` to generate the release jar (modify gradle.properties version
variable accordingly)

Run `./gradlew release` to generate the .exe and the .jar.

To use vulkan with debug and validation layers please install the vulkan Lunar SDK.

## Signature and due diligence

Since 1.0.24 we sign both commits and release files (as such each exe and jar are provided with a sha512 and the jar
with a signature and all of that is zipped then signed once again).

Signature can be verified with `gpg --verify Minemap-<version>.zip.asc Minemap-<version>.zip`.

You will need my signature which can be
found [here](https://keyserver.pgp.com/vkd/DownloadKey.event?keyid=0x0209520C14A4DEE7)
or [here](https://seedfinding.com/neil_pubkey.gpg.asc).

Then you will need to dearmor it: `gpg -o neil_pubkey.gpg --dearmor *.asc` and then import it or use directly:

`gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring neil_pubkey.gpg --verify Minemap-<version>.zip.asc Minemap-<version>.zip`

You can download a dearmored version [here](https://seedfinding.com/neil_pubkey.gpg) (fair warning do not open it in a
text editor as it is not ANSI)
